## 🎯 Why Files Were Archived

### **MV2 to MV3 Migration**
- `background.js` → `service-worker.js` (MV3 requirement)
- Old test files → New reliability test suite
- Inline event handlers → CSP-compliant external scripts

### **Reliability Improvements**
- Standalone health checker → Integrated monitoring system
- Basic tests → Comprehensive reliability test suite
- Manual testing → Automated test infrastructure

### **Code Organization**
- Scattered test files → Organized test structure
- Multiple service worker versions → Single active implementation
- Outdated documentation → Current comprehensive guides
