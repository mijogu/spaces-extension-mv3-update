# Service Worker "Going Dark" Analysis & Solution

## üîç Problem Analysis

### **The "Going Dark" Issue**
The extension becomes unresponsive after a few minutes, requiring a manual refresh to restore functionality. This is a common problem with MV3 service workers due to their ephemeral nature.

### **Root Causes Identified**

1. **Conflicting Heartbeat Mechanisms**
   - Original service worker had TWO `setInterval` calls (lines 58 and 1223)
   - Intervals were interfering with each other
   - No proper cleanup of intervals

2. **Heavy Initialization on Startup**
   - Service worker initialized immediately on `onStartup` and `onInstalled`
   - Blocked activation with heavy operations
   - No timeout protection for initialization

3. **Inconsistent Activity Tracking**
   - Activity tracking wasn't robust enough
   - No persistence of activity state
   - Inactivity detection was too lenient (5 minutes)

4. **Missing State Persistence**
   - Critical state not saved before termination
   - No recovery mechanism for terminated service workers
   - Window tracking lost on restart

5. **Poor Error Recovery**
   - No retry logic for failed operations
   - No graceful degradation
   - Service worker could get stuck in bad state

## üöÄ Improved Solution

### **Key Improvements**

#### 1. **Enhanced Lifecycle Management**
```javascript
// Non-blocking activation
self.addEventListener('activate', (event) => {
    console.log('‚ö° Service worker activated...');
    event.waitUntil(Promise.resolve()); // Don't block
});

// Proper termination handling
self.addEventListener('beforeunload', (event) => {
    console.log('üíÄ Service worker being terminated...');
    stopMonitoring();
    // Save critical state
    chrome.storage.local.set({
        serviceWorkerTerminated: true,
        lastTermination: Date.now(),
        wasInitialized: isInitialized
    });
});
```

#### 2. **Robust Monitoring System**
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: 25000, // 25 seconds - more frequent
    ACTIVITY_CHECK_INTERVAL: 30000, // 30 seconds
    MAX_INACTIVE_TIME: 120000, // 2 minutes - shorter
    INITIALIZATION_TIMEOUT: 10000, // 10 seconds
    MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS: 3
};
```

#### 3. **Improved Initialization with Retry Logic**
```javascript
async function initializeServiceWorker() {
    let attempts = 0;
    
    while (attempts < CONFIG.MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS) {
        try {
            attempts++;
            // Set timeout for initialization
            const initPromise = performInitialization();
            const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
                setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Initialization timeout')), CONFIG.INITIALIZATION_TIMEOUT)
            );
            
            await Promise.race([initPromise, timeoutPromise]);
            // Success - break out of retry loop
            break;
        } catch (error) {
            if (attempts >= CONFIG.MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS) {
                throw error;
            }
            // Exponential backoff
            const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, attempts - 1), 5000);
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4. **State Persistence & Recovery**
```javascript
// Save activity to storage
function updateActivity() {
    lastActivityTime = Date.now();
    chrome.storage.local.set({ 
        lastActivityTime: lastActivityTime,
        serviceWorkerActive: true
    });
}

// Restore state on initialization
async function restoreState() {
    const result = await chrome.storage.local.get([
        'spacesOpenWindowId', 
        'spacesPopupWindowId',
        'lastActivityTime'
    ]);
    
    if (result.spacesOpenWindowId) spacesOpenWindowId = result.spacesOpenWindowId;
    if (result.spacesPopupWindowId) spacesPopupWindowId = result.spacesPopupWindowId;
    if (result.lastActivityTime) lastActivityTime = result.lastActivityTime;
}
```

#### 5. **Enhanced Error Recovery**
```javascript
async function handleMessageWithInitialization(request, sender, sendResponse) {
    try {
        checkInactivity();
        
        if (!isInitialized) {
            await initializeServiceWorker();
        }
        
        await handleMessage(request, sender, sendResponse);
        
    } catch (error) {
        if (!isInitialized) {
            resetServiceWorker();
            try {
                await initializeServiceWorker();
                await handleMessage(request, sender, sendResponse);
            } catch (recoveryError) {
                sendResponse({ 
                    error: recoveryError.message,
                    recoveryFailed: true,
                    serviceWorkerState: { isInitialized, monitoring: !!(heartbeatInterval && activityCheckInterval) }
                });
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## üìä Comparison: Before vs After

| Aspect | Original | Improved |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Heartbeat** | 2 conflicting intervals (60s, 30s) | Single coordinated interval (25s) |
| **Inactivity Detection** | 5 minutes | 2 minutes |
| **Initialization** | Immediate, blocking | Lazy, non-blocking |
| **Error Recovery** | None | Retry with exponential backoff |
| **State Persistence** | None | Full state save/restore |
| **Monitoring** | Basic | Comprehensive health monitoring |
| **Termination Handling** | None | Proper cleanup and state save |

## üìù Implementation Notes

The improved service worker (`js/service-worker-improved.js`) implements all the recommended MV3 patterns and should significantly reduce the "going dark" issue. The solution is backward compatible and maintains all existing functionality while adding robust reliability features.

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the improved service worker thoroughly
2. Deploy gradually to monitor for any issues
3. Collect metrics on service worker health
4. Iterate based on real-world usage data
